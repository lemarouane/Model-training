1. Training Loss (Blue Line):
The blue line shows how many mistakes the model makes while learning from the training data.
As training progresses, the line goes down steadily, which means the model is getting better and making fewer mistakes.
This steady decline means the model is learning well without just memorizing the training examples.
2. Validation Loss (Orange Line):
The orange line shows how well the model does when predicting new, unseen data.
It follows the blue line very closely, which is a good sign! This means the model is learning general patterns and is not just remembering the examples it has seen.
Unlike before, this orange line is smooth, with fewer ups and downs, meaning the model is now more stable and reliable.
3. No Overfitting:
Both lines (blue and orange) are going down together, which means the model is not just getting good at the training data but is also learning well enough to handle new, unseen data.
4. What Did We Fix?:
Before, the model was learning too much from the training data and struggling with new data (overfitting). Now, thanks to some changes (like stopping early and adding some techniques to make learning more general), it’s learning the right balance and is much more accurate on both training and new data.
In Simple Terms:
The model is now learning the right way: it’s getting better at both the old examples (training) and the new ones (validation), without making big mistakes. This makes the model reliable and useful when handling new, unseen data.
